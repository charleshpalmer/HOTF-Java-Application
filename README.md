# HOTF-Java-Application

This application was produced for the purpose of practicing my use of Java to create minimalistic GUI applications.

This application utalized the MVC convention and provides functionality for a 'House of the Future', allowing for operation of smart devices around the home, including deciding time on, energy used and location querys. And creating custom objects that allow the user to add new items that were not already listed, providing additional functionality. 

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

Java, Apache Netbeans IDE.
